This website is a modern E-Learning Platform designed to provide an interactive online learning experience for students. It includes a dashboard that shows learning progress, course listings with enrollment options, a course detail page with video lessons and progress tracking, and a profile section for managing user information.
The website uses a sidebar navigation system to switch between pages without reloading, making the user experience smooth and dynamic. Progress bars, course cards, and responsive layout make the platform visually appealing and easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
